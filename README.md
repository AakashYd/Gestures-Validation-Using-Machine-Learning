# Gestures-Validation-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning for real-time hand gesture recognition. It employs computer vision techniques to classify gestures (good or bad) with algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the system provides real-time feedback and performs actions based on gestures.


# Gesture Validation Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements real-time hand gesture recognition using machine learning techniques. It classifies gestures as "Good" or "Bad" based on predefined criteria. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the system leverages machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks for accurate gesture validation.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition.
- Gesture classification: Good vs. Bad.
- Machine learning models: Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks.
- Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
- Real-time feedback and action execution based on gestures.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run the following command to start the gesture validation system:

```bash
python gesture_validation.py
```
# Hand Gesture Detection and Classification

This will launch a video stream that detects hand gestures and classifies them in real-time.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn (for ML models)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for Neural Networks)
