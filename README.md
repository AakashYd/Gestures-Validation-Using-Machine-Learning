# Gestures-Validation-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning for real-time hand gesture recognition. It employs computer vision techniques to classify gestures (good or bad) with algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the system provides real-time feedback and performs actions based on gestures.
